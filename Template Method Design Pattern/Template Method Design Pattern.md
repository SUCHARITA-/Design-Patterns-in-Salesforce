### Template Method Design Pattern

The Template Method design pattern comes under Behavioral Design Patterns. It primarily deals with the behavior of objects, defining the skeleton of an algorithm and allowing subclasses to alter certain steps without changing the overall structure of the algorithm.

#### Use Case

Imagine you are developing a data processing framework that needs to process data from various sources (e.g., CSV files, databases, and web services). The steps to process data are generally the same, but the way data is read and parsed varies depending on the source.

Or let's say in a banking application, you need to process different types of financial transactions (e.g., deposits and withdrawals). Both transactions share a common workflow but have specific rules and validations.
